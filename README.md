## 📝 Description
This project was developed as part of my data visualization portfolio to demonstrate my ability to connect multiple data sources, build relationships, and create an interactive Tableau dashboard. It simulates a real-world sales analysis scenario where key decision-makers monitor KPIs, explore sales patterns, and make data-driven business decisions.
